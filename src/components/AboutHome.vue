        <h3 class="text-body-1 text-left pb-5">What is meant by reading a book?
          Reading books is an activity that has many benefits in everyday life. This is because books are a source of
          knowledge that can add and update insights. In fact, routinely reading books is also believed to be able to
          increase one's concentration and empathy.</h3>
        <h3 class="text-body-1 text-left">Reading activities have specific goals according to the person reading. The
          main
          purpose of reading is to understand all the information contained in the reading text to develop the

          difficult to compete in the world of work and survive in the current era.</h3>

          videos, news media, social media or others. However, books are the main thing and the most standard source of
          information and there are very few errors.</h3>
